        Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, <em>certainly</em> can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <em>Nobody’s</em> good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        <em>Thankfully</em>, we are <strong>born to learn</strong> .<br>
        Slowly. <em>Surely.</em> You stumble, slip, crawl, <em>fall and fail and fall</em>.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until <em>one day</em>, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a <em>little</em> bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. <em>is.</em> <strong>learning</strong>.<br>
        It’s not that you <em>don’t</em> get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, <strong>yet.</strong>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know <strong>one</strong> thing:<br>
        <strong>You can <em>learn</em> anything.</strong>
